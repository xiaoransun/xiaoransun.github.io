As a developmental and family psychologist, I conduct research on the interplay between family systems processes and well-being across adolescence and young adulthood, situated in the larger socio-ecological context. In addition, with my data science background, I am particularly interested in applying innovative methods and data to family and developmental research. Research topics include:
- [**Families and youth in the digital context**](#1-families-and-youth-in-the-digital-context)
- [**Machine learning for research on family experiences and youth achievements**](#2-machine-learning-for-research-on-family-experiences-and-youth-achievements)
- [**Family dynamics and adolescents' and young adults' development towards achievement**](#3-family-dynamics-and-adolescents-and-young-adults-development-towards-achievement)
-  [**Longitudinal dyadic data analysis of family processes**](#4-longitudinal-dyadic-data-analysis-of-family-processes)

#### (1) Families and youth in the digital context.
Digital technology is ubiquitous and pervasive in individuals’ and families’ life. Thus, the digital context is an increasingly important context to consider in the social ecology of families and youth. How do family interactions unfold in the digital world? What are the implications of family digital interactions for family functioning and youth well-being? <br/>

To answer these questions, currently I am leading the *Family Screenome Project*, based on the <a href="https://screenomics.stanford.edu/">Screenomics approach</a>, to collect temporally dense, imaged-based data streams from smartphones of adolescents and parents, along with bi-weekly survey data on their relationship quality and well-being. This project is passively and unobtrusively collecting screenshots from participants’ smartphones every 5 seconds whenever the smartphone screen is activated, across up to 6 months. With rich, objective data (~360k screenshots per participant on average) collected from this innovative approach on parents’ and adolescents’ digital behaviors, many questions with regard to family dynamics, digital communication, media effects, and adolescent well-being can be answered. See below a demonstration of how parent-young adult smartphone interactions based on screenome observations can be analyzed across multiple time scales.<br/>

Further, on this topic, another part of my work is theoretical, trying to synthesize past research and push for building a theoretical framework for families and technology.<br/>

#### (2) Machine learning for research on family experiences and youth achievements.
With booming big data and wide access to computational power, the utility of machine learning methods is gaining attention in social sciences. My research involves building machine learning (ML) models on large-scale datasets that use adolescent experiences as features in predicting their future achievement outcomes. For example, using the Add Health data, a nationally representative, large-scale dataset, I used ML to develop a paradigm for a data-based cross-study synthesis, examining the predictive value of high-dimensional data on adolescent family experiences for young adult educational achievement. Questions that I am trying to answer include, but not limited to: How important are family experiences in adolescence in predicting young adult achievement outcomes? Which family experience factors are the best predictors of achievements? What complex patterns among family experience in the predictions emerge (*see example plots below*)? Answering these questions using ML can not only facilitate theoretical understandings about families and youth development towards achievement, but can also inform precision intervention on promoting future achievement outcomes by targeting at important factors. As a fast-developing area, the application of ML paradigm in family and developmental research, I believe, will lead to a proliferation of new discoveries and practical implications, research papers and grants.<br/>

#### (3) Family dynamics and adolescents' and young adults' development towards achievement.
 My work contributes to the understanding of *long-term implications of early family experiences*, especially those with parents and siblings across middle childhood and adolescence, for achievement outcomes in young adulthood. By incorporating the experiences of *multiple family members*, my research highlights within-family differences including between mothers and fathers and between siblings, as well as the role of gender in developmental outcomes. Further, my work examines *contexts for family dynamics*, especially the cultural context and family members’ work experiences. I conduct this line of work in collaboration with <a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/contact/susan-mchale">Susan McHale</a> (Penn State), <a href="https://thesanfordschool.asu.edu/content/kimberly-updegraff">Kimberly Updegraff</a> (Arizona State University), and <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/adriana-umana-taylor">Adriana Umaña-Taylor</a> (Harvard University).

#### (4) Longitudinal dyadic data analysis of family processes.
Family systems are complex, and I have been interested in applying methods to capture their complexity. One step is applying dyadic data analytics to examine whether and how partners’ experiences and individual characteristics are linked to their own and to the other’s relationship experiences. In this research line, I have focused on *actor-partner interdependence modeling,* especially the adaptation of this method to analysis of longitudinal data collected from family dyads, including *couple, parent-youth, and sibling dyads.* Findings highlight the interdependence of family members’ experiences over time, and gender asymmetry in influence processes.
