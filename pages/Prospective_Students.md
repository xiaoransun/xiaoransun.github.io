I am actively looking for students who have strong interests and background in working at the intersections of family dynamics (family systems processes), adolescent and young adult development (achievements & well-being), and methodologies and data sciences.

#### Prospective Ph.D. Students

I have fully-funded Ph.D. positions in the <a href="https://www.cehd.umn.edu/fsos/index.html">Department of Family Social Science</a>, <a href="https://www.cehd.umn.edu/">College of Education and Human Development</a>, at University of Minnesota, starting Fall 2022. <br/>

If you are interested in working with me, I encourage you to apply to the FSoS PhD program and mention me in your statement. Feel free to contact me via email with the title “Prospective PhD Student” and include the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts; (3) a brief description of your background and research interests; and (4) representative publications or writing samples if available.

#### Mentoring Philosophy
My mentorship style is encouraging, scaffolding, constructive, and responsive, which has also been in the feedback from my prior mentees. Some highlights of my mentorship:
- I encourage students' exploration for career paths that they will be passionate about;
- I give constructive and in-time (within a week if not on vacation) feedback to students' work;
- I respect students' work-life balance and highlight the importance of mental health and self-care;
- I am responsive to my mentees' emails (within 24 hours if not on vacation);
- I value transparent and open communication;
- As a junior faculty member, I would be glad to connect my students for collaboration opportunities with senior colleagues.
