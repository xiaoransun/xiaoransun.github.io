<li>To illuminate how <u>within‐family differences</u> in achievement may emerge, this study examined <u>sibling experiences</u> in <u>middle childhood</u> as predictors of sibling differences in <u>college graduation</u>. First‐ and second‐borns from 152 families reported on their experiences with siblings and parents at ages 11.80 (SD = 0.56) and 9.22 (SD = 0.90), respectively, and on their educational attainment at about age 26. Significant childhood predictors of sibling differences in college graduation status included <u>low sibling warmth, fathers’ differential time spent with siblings, and perceived unfair differential treatment by parents</u>. Findings suggest long‐term implications of early sibling dynamics for educational attainment and provided novel insights into families’ role in achievement.</li>

Longitudinal links between work experiences and marital satisfaction in African American dual-earner couples. *Journal of Family Psychology, 31,* 1029-1039. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/fam0000381">http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/fam0000381</a>

<li>This study assessed associations between both <u>work demands (pressure, hours)</u> and <u>work resources (self-direction)</u> and <u>marital satisfaction</u> in a sample of 164 <u>African American dual-earner couples</u> who were interviewed annually across 3 years. Grounded in the work–home resources and family systems frameworks, results from <u>longitudinal actor–partner interdependence models (APIM)</u> revealed main effects of spouses’ work experiences on their own marital satisfaction, but these effects were qualified by the interactive effects of spouses’ and partners’ work experiences. Some interactive effects were consistent with an <u>amplifying pattern</u>, for example that, beyond the main effects of actor self-direction, marital satisfaction was highest when both spouses experienced high work self-direction. Other effects were consistent with a <u>comparative pattern</u>, such that shorter work hours were linked to lower marital satisfaction only when partners worked longer hours. Gender moderation also was evident in findings that wives’ work pressure was negatively linked to marital satisfaction only when their husbands reported high pressure, but husbands’ work pressure was negatively linked to marital satisfaction only when their wives reported low pressure. This study advances understanding of work–marriage linkages in African American couples, an understudied group with a distinctive connection to the labor force. Analyses demonstrate what can be learned from investigating the <u>couple as a unit</u> and illustrate how family systems concepts can be addressed via APIM. </li>
