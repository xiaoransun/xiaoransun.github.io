Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in Human Development and Family Studies at Pennsylvania State University. My graduate minor is Social Data Analytics. I started my graduate program study in August, 2015 and expect to complete in August, 2019. <br/>

My research interests: <br/>
(1) Adolescents’ and young adults’ educational achievement and career development, with a specific focus on the role of gender and family dynamics in youth development and achievement among families from different sociocultural backgrounds; <br/>
(2) Methodological approaches to analyzing individual development and family systems, such as growth curve analysis and dyadic/multi-member data analysis; <br/>
(3) Computational social science, with a focus on utilizing large-scale and big data and machine learning methods to inform developmental and family research. 

I primarily work with Drs. <a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/contact/susan-mchale">Susan McHale</a>, <a href="https://quantdev.ssri.psu.edu/people/nur5">Nilam Ram</a>, and <a href="http://www.landdevelopability.org/chi/">Guangqing Chi</a> at Penn State, and Dr. <a href="https://thesanfordschool.asu.edu/content/kimberly-updegraff">Kimberly Updegraff</a> at Arizona State University.

I am currently on the job market looking for post-doc positions related to big data/data mining and family/youth development.
