### Xiaoran Sun (孙潇然)


Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, affiliated with the Department of Pediatrics and Department of Communication, and in the <a href="https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program">Stanford Data Science Scholar Program</a>. <br/>

My current work is mainly involved with <a href="http://screenomics.stanford.edu/">The Screenomics Lab</a> and the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/genpeds/research/solutions-science-lab.html">Solutions Science Lab</a>. <br/>

I obtained my PhD degree in Human Development and Family Studies from the Pennsylvania State University in August 2019, with a graduate minor in Social Data Analytics. 

<b>Research keywords: </b> <br/>
Adolescent and young adult well-being; <br/>
Family dynamics, contexts around families (technology, work experiences, sociocultural context); <br/>
Computational social science; innovative statistical and computational methods for studying family and youth development<br/>

My research involves: <br/>
(1) <b>Family dynamics and adolescents' and young adults' well-being.</b> </br>
My work contributes to the understanding of long-term implications of early family experiences, especially those with parents and siblings across middle childhood and adolescence, for developmental outcomes in the domains of love and work in young adulthood. Further, by incorporating the experiences of multiple family members, my research highlights within-family differences including between mothers and fathers and between siblings, as well as the role of gender in developmental outcomes. Findings from my work also have practical implications for family-focused interventions aimed at promoting youth well-being and positive family functioning. <br/>

(2) <b>Big data and family research: Mining social media data and analyzing large-scale data with machine learning.</b> My traineeship in the <a href="https://soda.la.psu.edu/igert">Penn State NSF Big Data Social Science-IGERT program</a> ignited my interest in research at the intersection of data science and social science, especially leveraging the power of big data and machine learning algorithms for new discoveries about family dynamics and youth development. One direction I have pursued is *using data and innovative methods to study the role of technology in family processes*. I also led a research project using Twitter data (starting with ~4.8 million tweets) to study *sibling interactions on social media*, a project that included training and supervising two undergraduate and one Masters student research assistants. This work developed into another project that involves developing techniques to identify sibling users on Twitter (<a href="https://github.com/xiaoransun/Twitter_National_Sibling_Day">GitHub repo</a>). Observing that few family and child development scholars have recognized *the innovations that machine learning algorithms can bring to analysis of large-scale data*, I organized a symposium on this topic at an international conference for research on child development. Further, I led in developing a paper that *uses machine learning to develop a paradigm for data-based cross-study synthesis*; this paper examines the predictive value of high-dimensional family experiences in youth achievement and identify key predictors for young adult educational attainment. <br/>
